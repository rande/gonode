Assets
======

This directory will only contains a gofile generated by go-bindata with all assets required by the project.

The ``bindata.go`` is generated only on build and should not be commited.

The assets can contains any template files or front files (js, css, images, ...)

Please note, the ``go-bindata`` must be run from ``GOPATH`` folder, so the assets references will be unique accross different projects.
